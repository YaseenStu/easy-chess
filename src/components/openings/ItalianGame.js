            The opening movements of the Italian game are 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4,
            with an emphasis on quick center growth and control. One of the oldest openings
            in chess, this classical style is distinguished by its open and strategic play. It
            creates the conditions for both players to compete for the center without having to
            rush into any rough play. Rich middle-game positions can be reached with both the Giuoco
            Piano and the Two Knights Defense key variations.

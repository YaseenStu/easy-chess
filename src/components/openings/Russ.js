            Russian Defense, Also known as the Petrov Defense, this opening begins with the moves 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nf6, challenging White’s center immediately and mirroring White’s knight development. It is known for its symmetrical structure and solid properties, allowing Black to solve development issues quickly. The Russian Defense requires accurate play from Black to counter White’s initiative and can lead to drawish tendencies in some lines.

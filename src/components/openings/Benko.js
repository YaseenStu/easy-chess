            The Benko Gambit, which is started by 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 b5, gives up a pawn in exchange for
            considerable long-term pressure on the queenside. In order to make up for the material delays,
            black attempts to actively play and gain control of the a and b files with rooks. Those who are
            proactive and looking for dynamic opportunities against White's setup often start with this opening.

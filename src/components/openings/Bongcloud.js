            Using the moves 1.e4 e5 2.Ke2, the king advances early to e2 in the rather unusual and frequently
            comical Bongcloud Attack chess opening. Conventional opening principles advise avoiding making early
            king movements, and this move is generally regarded as a violation of such guidelines. The main
            attraction of the Bongcloud is not its strategic soundness, but rather its shock value and the
            disruption it brings to traditional chess conventions.

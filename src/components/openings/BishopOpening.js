            With movements 1.e4 e5 2.Bc4, the Bishop's Opening takes aim at the vulnerable f7 square
            right away in the opening phase of the game. White can choose to lead the game into either
            an open or closed structure with this opening, which is a forerunner to many lines in the Italian Game.
            To give Black something to work on right away in the beginning phase, piece development and central control are prioritized.

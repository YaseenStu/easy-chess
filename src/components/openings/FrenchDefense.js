            The French Defense is renowned for its strength and durability, especially
            after starting with 1.e4 e6. By keeping up a solid pawn chain from d5 to e6,
            Black can threaten White's core. When Black tries to counterplay on the queenside
            while defending the kingside, the French Defense typically results in closed constructions.
            The Winawer, Tarrasch, and Classical are notable variations that provide various pawn layouts
            and strategies to suit varying tactical inclinations.

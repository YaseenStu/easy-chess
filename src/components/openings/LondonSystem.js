            The London System is a system opening that White can use against nearly all of
            Black's setups. It usually starts with d4, followed by Nf3, Bf4, e3, c3, and Bd3.
            This opening is well-known for its soundness, and it requires less theoretical understanding
            than more mainstream openings. It encourages gradual development and strategic games, making it
            popular among both club players and grandmasters.

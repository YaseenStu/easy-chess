            The Queen's Gambit and Reti Opening are combined to create the Catalan Opening, which gives
            White a large amount of center control while fianchettingtoing the king's bishop. It is opened
            with 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.g3. The persistent pressure in the center and on the queenside of this
            opening is well-known for producing positions that are strong in both strategy and tactics. Because
            of its stability and dynamic potential, the Catalan is favored at the top levels.

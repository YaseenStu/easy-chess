                        The Grob Opening, one of the more unusual and uncommon opening moves,
                        begins with 1.g4. Its goal is to disturb the standard pawn structure and piece
                        development from the very first move. At the highest levels of play, it is uncommon,
                        but it can result in very crisp games with opportunities for both players, usually in
                        favor of the well-prepared player.

            A <strong>pin</strong> is a powerful tactical weapon in chess where a defending piece is immobilized because moving it would expose a more valuable piece behind it, usually the king or queen. This tactic can paralyze an opponentâ€™s piece and restrict their options, leading to gains in material or other advantages.
          </p>

            There are two types of pins in chess:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Absolute pin:</strong> where the piece is pinned against the king, making it illegal to move the pinned piece because it would put the king in check.</li>
              <li><strong>Relative pin:</strong> where moving the pinned piece would expose a more valuable piece to capture but is not illegal.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
